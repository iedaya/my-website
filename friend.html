<p> <hr> <font face="VNI-Disney" font size="5%">She has been my best friend since primary school. We have been friends since primary school until now. 
He is still my best friend. Her name is Nur Mashitah, but I love to call her Che ta nickname. 
She is a cheerful person. I'd like to be friends with her. Besides that, she works as a clinic assistant near her home. 
She lives near my home, so that's why we often go out to hang out together. Since I lived on campus, we didn't always meet because we were busy with each other’s work.
But on weekends, I would go home, and he was the first to take me out with her. We always spend the holidays together by going for a jog in our housing estate, and in the afternoon, 
we will go out to buy snacks and hang out while eating together in the park. 
We didn't always take pictures, but if we met, we often recorded videos as memories. Like, we always make TikTok videos together.
